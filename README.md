An income tax calculator is a web-based tool that allows individuals to estimate their annual income tax liability. This type of calculator is typically built using a combination of front-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which work together to provide a user-friendly interface and instant feedback on the user's estimated tax obligations. By integrating these technologies, an income tax calculator can offer a seamless and interactive experience, making the process of estimating income taxes more accessible and transparent for the user.
